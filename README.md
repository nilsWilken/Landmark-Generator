This is a modified version of Fast Downward to turn it into a landmark extractor. 

The original FD code was modified so that it prints out the landmark generation graph and exits afterwards.

Hence, this project can be used as a landmark generator that is able to use all landmark extraction algorithms implemented in FD.

For more information on how to use Fast Downward, please go to their official website: http://www.fast-downward.org/.
